# Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)
#
# Required modules: mod_dav, mod_dav_fs, mod_setenvif, mod_alias
#                   mod_auth_digest, mod_authn_file
#

# The following example gives DAV write access to a directory called
# "uploads" under the ServerRoot directory.
#
# The User/Group specified in httpd.conf needs to have write permissions
# on the directory where the DavLockDB is placed and on any directory where
# "Dav On" is specified.

Alias /uploads "/var/www/uploads"

<Directory "/var/www/uploads">
    AllowOverride All
    Dav On

    <Limit GET HEAD POST DELETE OPTIONS PUT>
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow from all
    </Limit>
</Directory>

#
# The following directives disable redirects on non-GET requests for
# a directory that does not include the trailing slash.  This fixes a
# problem with several clients that do not appropriately handle
# redirects for folders with DAV methods.
